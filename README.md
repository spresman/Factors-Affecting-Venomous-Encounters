# Factors affecting Venomous Encounters

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine whether separate factors have an effect on an outcome using a difference of means approach. This particular 3-way ANOVA tests the effect of a country's
population density, percent of terrestrial protected area, and number of endemic species (species only found in those countries) on the number of instances of venomous animal contact per 100,000 individuals. It basically looks for an interaction between the variable and the outcome. A statistically significant result (p-value > .05) would imply that the factor does have an effect on the outcome.

There is a strong statistically significant interaction between a country's percent of terrestrial protected area and its number of venomous encounters. There also seems
to be a significant result when viewing the population density and the number of venomous encounters of a country.

Logically, both our statistical significant outcomes make sense!
More protected areas mean more protected animals, which of course also includes venomous animals. A higher population density may imply less space for *all* organisms, meaning
more interactions between humans and animals, which again, includes the venomous ones.
